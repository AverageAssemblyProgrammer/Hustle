# Hustle

WARNING!! HUSTLE IS A EXPERIMENTAL LANGUAGE. IT IS NOT COMPLETE.

THIS ALL IS JUST FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE MOSTLY WORKS 
I HAVE NOT DONE ANY WORK FOR THE LEXING AND PARSING LITTERALLY ALL OF THE WORK IS FROM CODEPULSE'S TUTORIAL ON HOW TO MAKE A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
I AM SORRY IF I WAS LATE TO GIVE THE CREDIT BUT AFTER I GET FAMILAR WITH HOW A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE WORKS I WILL BE MAKING MY OWN COMPILED VERSION OF HUSTLE AND DELEAT THIS ONE 

codepulse's tutorial:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eythq9848Fg&list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD

# Installation

give your password, and you are done

# Quick Start

```console

$ ./hustle.py run examples/fizzbuzz.hsle
```

# MileStones
- [x] Turing-Complete
- [ ] Compiled into intermidiate representation
- [ ] Stactic Type Checking
- [ ] More Faster then this language:- https://github.com/iacobucci/stupid_language
- [ ] memory allocation


# Make a hustle file a exe

```example
#!/usr/bin/hustle.py runme 
```
put this line at the start of your program, then give it 
executable permisions and then run it as a exe.
DO NOT FORGET TO PUT "runme" AT THE END OF THE LINE OTHERWISE THE PROGRAM WILL FAIL
