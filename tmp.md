# Memory Allocation 

how will memory allocation work in my language:-
it will be a little simmilar to tsoding's way cause I liked his idea

if you want to allocate a chunk of memory, you will use the memory function 
example:- 
```program 
new mem 120 end
```
all numbers are represented by kilo bytes
