# Hustle

WARNING!! HUSTLE IS A EXPERIMENTAL LANGUAGE. IT IS NOT COMPLETE.
MANY THINGS HAVE STOPED WORKING WHILE I AM ADDING COMPILATION HUSTLE
NO PROGRAMS THAT WORKED IN THE PAST WILL WORK NOW, 0 PERCENT BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY FOR NOW
I WILL ADD THE REST OF THE FEATURES FOR COMPILATION MODE AS TIME GOES ON 

This project was writen with its base being the Youtube tutorial [Make YOUR OWN Programming Language](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD) by [CodePulse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUVahoidFA7F3Asfvamrm7w). The only difference is that his language is interpreted while my language is interpreted and compiled to assembly code.
Thanks for his help for the awesome tutorial.

# MileStones
- [ ] Turing-Complete
- [ ] Compiled into intermidiate representation (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Memory Allocation
- [ ] Stactic Type Checking
- [ ] Optimized 
- [ ] Cross Platform


# Future Plans
- [ ] Remove interpreter mode (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] re-write the compiler's lexer and parser
- [ ] Create Documentaion (after completing the compilation mode)
