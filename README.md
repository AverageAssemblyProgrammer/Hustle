# Hustle

WARNING!! HUSTLE IS A EXPERIMENTAL LANGUAGE. IT IS NOT COMPLETE.
MANY THINGS HAVE STOPED WORKING WHILE I AM ADDING COMPILATION HUSTLE
NO PROGRAMS THAT WORKED IN THE PAST WILL WORK NOW, 0 PERCENT BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY FOR NOW
I WILL ADD THE REST OF THE FEATURES FOR COMPILATION MODE AS TIME GOES ON
